#Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array,
# using a recursive merge sort methodology.
# Tips:
# Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again
# and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
# It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you donâ€™t quite
# understand what should be going on.


# Pseudo code for recursive merge_sort method:

# Build a recursive merge sort that takes an array as a parameter
# and returns a sorted version of that array

# Base case, if the array is of length 1 then the array is sorted

# divide the array in 2 pieces as even as possible
# Sort the left piece, aka call the recursive method on the left piece
# Sort the right piece, aka call the recursive method on the right piece
# Merge the two pieces
  # declare an empty array named 'sorted'
  # compare the first element of the left piece to the first element of the right piece
  # shift the smaller element and push it to 'sorted'
  # if both left and right pieces are empty
  # return cause merge is complete

my_array = [4, 5, 7, 1, 3, 6, 2]
my_simples_array = [2, 1, 3]
